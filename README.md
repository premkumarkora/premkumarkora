## Executive Summary

As a **Principal AI Architect, PMP-Certified and MBA**, I offer a rare combination: 6+ years of cutting-edge Generative AI specialization built on a foundation of 25+ years of Enterprise Engineering & Leadership. I bridge the dangerous gap between "Business Strategy" and "Technical Execution." While others prototype concepts, I translate ambiguous business requirements into high-performance, autonomous AI systems that deliver measurable ROI.
I specialize in designing **Enterprise Agentic Workflows**, **Secure RAG Systems**, and **Multi-Agent Orchestration** for regulated industries (Insurance, Healthcare, Finance).

Currently, I focus on translating ambiguous business requirements into scalable AI solutions that deliver tangible ROI, ensuring data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.

### Strategic Impact & ROI
* **$1.8M Claims Automation:** Architected an Agentic AI platform on AWS (Claude/Titan) that autonomously processes **80% of claims**, reducing cycle time from 5.2 to 1.1 days.
* **$1.0M Cost Avoidance:** Engineered a secure RAG application for policy analysis, eliminating 100% of manual data capture for adjusters.
* **85% Efficiency Gain:** Deployed a Multi-Agent GenAI platform unifying 52 reporting systems, saving **$340K annually**.
